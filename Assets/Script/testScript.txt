[BoxState i=2]I uh...[TalkSpeed f=0.023]I don't really have much to show. [Delay f=1]Um.
[CharExpress i=0 s=chenSerious2][BoxState i=2]Since this is kind of my first really big programming project, I've been having to\nspend a lot of time reworking stuff that was broken or not very future proof.
[CharExpress i=0 s=chenSmile][BoxState i=2]For example, this cool scrolling background on the dialogue bubble?
[CharExpress i=0 s=chenUnamused][BoxState i=2]Breaks if you try to change the alpha with animations.
[CharExpress i=0 s=chenStressedSmile][BoxState i=2]I could probably fix this by making a simple shader and adjusting that over\ntime to coordinate with the dialogue box animations...
[CharExpress i=0 s=chenUnamused][BoxState i=2]But to do that, I need to change out pretty much all my code involving timing.\nUnity really doesn't offer great tools for that out of the box.
[CharExpress i=0 s=chenSerious2][BoxState i=2]I've never touched shader programming, either. There's a great video on it in\nthe discord, but it's five hours long and I've made it maybe twenty minutes in.
[CharExpress i=0 s=chenStressedSmile][BoxState i=2][UnderColor c=0.69,0,1,0.75]Oh,[Delay f=0.2] and I can change the color of the text underlay now!
[CharExpress i=0 s=chenStressedSmile2][BoxState i=2][TalkSpeed f=0.2][UnderColor c=0,0,0,0.5]. . .[TalkSpeed f=0.023][Delay f=1]yeah that's about all that's new
[CharExpress i=0 s=chenUnamused][BoxState i=2]Honestly[TalkSpeed f=0.1]...[TalkSpeed f=0.023]I should probably just call it a loss and take a strike for this\ncheckpoint.
[CharExpress i=0 s=chenSerious][BoxState i=2]Especially since I have nothing to show for art and story[BoxState i=0][LoadScene s=Checkpoint1 s=checkpoint1]
