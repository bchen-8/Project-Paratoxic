@OrangeJules-ce
[MessageSender i=1]Yo sorry, I didnt notice my phone light up earlier today. What's going on bro?
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=4]oh thank god you're alive
[SetVFX i=0 i=1]kinda just need someone to talk to rn
[MessageSender i=1]Then call me, you know I don't check my messages like that
[MessageSender i=0]i would but like
throat's kinda messed up rn .-.
[MessageSender i=1]What do you mean?
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=0]so uh this morning
i kinda suddenly woke up w/ some blood under my fingernails
and couldn't move my head without hurting like mad
went to check the mirror and the entire front of my neck had red scratches
apparently it happened while i was sleeping
[MessageSender i=1]What the hell?? 
Why didn't you ask for help this morning, I knocked on your door n everything
Why didn't you go to the clinic?
[MessageSender i=0]it's ok it was mostly surface level, there's like two cuts with a bit of blood
really red tho, itty bitty flakes of skin in a bunch of neat lines
feels like i got slapped in the neck with a hot coal
i patched myself up w the first aid kid
*kit
[MessageSender i=1]Young man, you will march yourself down to the nurse's office right now
[MessageSender i=0]applied the burn cream stuff whatever tf it is
and tied a gauze pad onto the danger zone just to be super safe
still kind of a pain to move my head but i think it's all good
[SetVFX i=0 i=1]also i'd have to walk to the clinic and that sounds like effort and neck pain
[MessageSender i=1]FFS Morgan, you can't just not tell us when you get hurt
This was happening when I was asking you to come along with us, right?
You better not be clamming up from the rest of the dormroom again
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=5]yeah but
i didn't want to ruin yalls celebration
idk this whole thing is awful and embarrassing and i'm overthinking like mad
[SetVFX i=0 i=4]congrats on landing the studio job btw i forgot to mention earlier
[MessageSender i=1]Uhh, about that
I actually don't have the job yet
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=6]??
[MessageSender i=1]Not important right now, though
Next time you try to keep stuff like this to yourself, we're taking your door off the hinges
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=0]wait no
[MessageSender i=1]I don't even know what to say, has this ever happened before?
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=5]no and it's got me kinda freaked out
i only messaged now 'cause my mind was really starting to run circles
being in my room without anyone around
[MessageSender i=1]And whose fault is that
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=2]touche
[MessageSender i=1]We were planning on getting back pretty soon, if you need anything
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=4]awesome, say hi to jae n peyton for me
[MessageSender i=1]I told them what happened
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=0]oh i guess that too
[MessageSender i=1]Did you replace the bandages since this morning? Or whenever it happened
[MessageSender i=0]yeah i've been swapping them out
[MessageSender i=1]I think Peyton forgot to restock the first aid kit, he's always using bandages
[MessageSender i=0]i have medical tape, it's all good
[MessageSender i=1]Huh, didn't know we had that
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=1]yeah haha
[MessageSender i=1]You said this happened in your sleep?
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=0]yeah
[SetVFX i=0 i=0]i think i might have an idea why
[MessageSender i=1]Oh?
[MessageSender i=0][StopMusic]last night i kinda had this
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=5]really bizarre nightmare
[SetVFX i=0 i=5][SpawnVFX s=ShowcaseDream][PlayMusic s=Paratoxic_Horror][ControlMode i=0][BringUpDialogue b=true][BlockInputWhilePrinting b=true]i'm not sure where to begin
[SpawnVFX s=DreamTextBG][Voice s=MorganGuardedHigh]...it was dark and foggy in every direction. I couldn't really see anything around me at all.
Except for a mirror, sitting right in front of my face.
[SetVFX i=1 i=1]Looking into it, I saw these...<color=red>abrasions</color>. All over my body.
Made of bone and sinew, protruding and bleeding.
I was blanketed with a dull sense of pain and overwhelming itchiness.
My limbs barely responded to me, as if they'd all fallen asleep.
I couldn't get this shrill ringing out of my ears, and I could barely lift my head.
[SetVFX i=1 i=2]When I finally managed to lift my eyes...
It was...<color=red>disgusting</color>.
An infected mass of cartilage and ligaments, pus pouring out of the edges.
[SetVFX i=1 i=3]I could hardly move. I could barely breathe.
It took all of my effort to force air into my lungs.
And I was starting to give out.
[SetVFX i=1 i=4]I had to get <color=red>this</color> out of my throat no matter what...
I kept clawing at my neck, but to no avail.
The <color=red>growth</color> began to close my windpipe.
My eyes weighed heavily. I shouldn't have been conscious.
[SetVFX i=1 i=5]But then, I felt <color=#773FEB>something</color> appear in my hands.
[SetVFX i=1 i=6]A wave of fear almost buckled my legs...
I knew what I had to do.
[SetVFX i=1 i=7]It felt like I was on the verge of collapsing as I lifted the dead weight of my arm up, <color=#773FEB>scalpel</color> in hand...
...and I decided to start from the top.
[StopMusic]If I just <color=red>carved it out</color>...I'd be able to breathe again, right?
[TalkSpeed f=0.08]<i>I just wanted to breathe</i>[TalkSpeed f=0.04]

[BringUpDialogue b=false][MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=1][BlockInputWhilePrinting b=false] 
uhh
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[SetVFX i=0 i=0][PlayMusic s=Paratoxic_Somber]i don't remember what happened after that
[MessageSender i=1]Good god, what the hell dude
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=6]huh?
[MessageSender i=1]We were just out getting food, why did you have to add so much visceral detail?
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=0]oh
[SetVFX i=0 i=3]um
[MessageSender i=1]I thought I was reading one of your short stories for a moment there
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=5]what
no
god no
i couldn't dream of writing something as fucked up as whatever i just experienced
this is a thing that actually just happened to me this morning and my neck still hurts
[MessageSender i=1]No, I get that it happened, I'm not doubting that
[MessageSender i=0]you sure about that?
[MessageSender i=1]I guess the way you phrased everything felt really similar to when you write
You should think about finding a therapist tomorrow, though.
What you just wrote right there isn't something to be taken lightly. 
Sounds like it could be indicative of something worse.
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=5]i told you this never happened before, it's probably just a one time thing
needed some way to vent about it
[MessageSender i=1]Anything I should know that you haven't told me?
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=2]nahhhhhhh
hope you enjoyed my shitty creepypasta, like comment n subscribe
[MessageSender i=1]I mean...look, I get it. You had this freak nightmare...
...but it looks like you already did everything you could to fix it
Sorry if it seemed like I was just brushing you off, but
I'm not really sure what I can do to help right this second
We're all going to be back soon anyways
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=0]i mean
idk i guess
playing it up as this dramatic story, turning it into sort of a writing exercise
just like, putting it out there into words
kinda helps
you know how it is when you talk about something that's been bubbling in your head
and all of a sudden it's not so bad
sorry if this is kinda weird
[SetVFX i=0 i=1][SetVFX i=0 i=1]dreams are some weird shit and this one tried to kill me apparently
[MessageSender i=1]Yeah, I've never heard of anything like this before
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=0][PlayMusic s=Paratoxic_Lofi]i think i'm feeling a little better now though
so
[MessageSender i=1]Glad to hear it
The bus is running kinda late right now, I'd say give us maybe half an hour to get back
[MessageSender i=0]gotcha
[MessageSender i=1]Honestly, I'm not really sure what to say about the whole thing
Hopefully just a crazy phenomenon like you said
You think you'll be physically alright by tomorrow?
It'd suck to have to go to class looking like that
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=4]thought about that actually
i found an old bandanna in my closet
[SetVFX i=0 i=1]tied it around my neck so people won't give me weird looks or whatever
[MessageSender i=1]Oh hey, smart idea. I hadn't thought of that
We're getting on the bus now, I'll see you in a bit. 
[SetVFX i=0 i=0]Get some water and rest on the couch in the living room.
You better not still be holed up in there by the time we get back
[MessageSender i=0]i will
[SetVFX i=0 i=6][SetVFX i=0 i=0]oh i've been meaning to ask
how's that one friend of yours doing?
the one you said was going through some shit last year
[SetVFX i=0 i=0]not sure why it came to mind but i'm curious
[MessageSender i=1]You mean Prim?
If so, it's actually kind of scary how much better she's doing right now lol
Almost like a completely new person
I still try to check in with her occasionally, but she seems to be holding up well
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=4]that's good to hear
[SetVFX i=0 i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=0]i just remember when you were stressing about that
didn't know if it got better or what
eta on getting here?
[MessageSender i=1]I'd say give it like twenty minutes, traffic lightened up. I'll catch up with you later bro
[MessageSender i=0][SetVFX i=0 i=1]aight
[SetVFX i=0 i=3]cya soon
